    "#### Problem overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing smoking and developing predictive models for smoking status using bio-signals is essential from an economic perspective due to its significant implications on healthcare costs and productivity losses. Smoking-related illnesses impose a heavy economic burden on societies worldwide, with costs arising from healthcare expenditures, decreased productivity due to illness or premature death, and other associated social costs. This study aims to develop and analyse a predictive model for smoker status using a dataset from Kaggle that includes various bio-signals and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adverse health effects of smoking are well-documented, including harm to nearly every organ, numerous diseases, and reduced life expectancy. According to a World Health Organization report, smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, with smoking-related deaths projected to reach 10 million by 2030.\n",
